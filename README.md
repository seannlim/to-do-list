# Sean's To-Do List Program

This is a simple command-line based to-do list program written in Python. The program allows users to add, remove, and list tasks with associated priorities and due dates. Tasks are saved to and loaded from a CSV file, making it easy to manage tasks between sessions.

## Features

- **Add Task**: Allows the user to add a new task with a description, priority, and due date.
- **Remove Task**: Enables the user to remove a task by its description.
- **List Tasks**: Displays the current list of tasks in a tabular format.
- **Save and Load Tasks**: Tasks are automatically saved to a CSV file when the program exits and loaded when the program starts.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tabulate` library (for pretty-printing the tasks)

You can install the `tabulate` library using pip:

```bash
pip install tabulate
